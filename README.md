# High-Level Programming Solutions by [Robert Malmstein](https://twitter.com/robertmalmstein)

**Welcome to Low-Level Programming!**

This repository contains assignment solutions from the low-level programming 
track at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com).

**Whats in here?**

This repo contains exercises, algorithms, data structure implementations, and 
other exercises written in C. [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com) emphasizes that 
the first three months be dedicated to learning the fundamentals of computer 
science with one of its founding languages.

## Styling and Specifications
All C programs are complied with gcc 4.8 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Coding style is based on the [Linux Kernel coding style]. All programs were written using vim. In most of the exercises, standard library functions were not used, except ``printf``, ``malloc``, ``free`` and  ``exit``. All necessary/helper functions were implemented from scratch. 

### Compilation
All programs are compiled using gcc with the flags below:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.##.c ##-name.c
```
